# Project 2: Urban Ministries Data and Shiny App

The second project for Introduction to Data Science, BIOS 611, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

## Data

This project will explore the Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Dataset by using a Shiny app.  This project to explore the amounts of food and clothes per month.

I have not yet decided on a seconary dataset, but this will likely include exploring open data from Durham county. [NOTE: not yet finished]

## Methods

This project will creat a Shiny app to allow users to explore the the amount of cothing and food over time.  

Methods will include an analysis of correlation and linear regression. A Tidyverse workflow will characterize the coding techniques of the data.

## Hypotheses

Currently, I hypothesize that the trend in clothes given and food pounds provided has increased over time.
