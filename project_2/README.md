# Project 2: Urban Ministries Data and Shiny App

The second project for Introduction to Data Science, BIOS 611, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

## Data

This project will explore the Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Dataset by using a Shiny app.  This project to explore the monthly amounts of food distributed by year and.

Data includes food pounds, visits per month, and the amount of people for whom food was provided.

## Methods

This project will create a Shiny app, allowing users to explore food trends over time for UMD.

Methods will include monthly counts for three variables: food pounds, monthly visits, and sum of people receiving food. 

This app is for exploratory pusposes and provides an opportunity to visualize data side-by-side in a dynamic way.

## Hypotheses

This analysis hyptohesizes that food pounds and monthly visits correspond by month, whereas there will be variance between monthly visits and people for whom food was provided.
