# Project 2: Urban Ministries Data and Shiny App

The second project for Introduction to Data Science, BIOS 611, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

## Data

This project will explore the Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) Dataset by using a Shiny app. I want to explore the amounts of food and clothes provided in relation to a climatic variable, like extreme heat months, days, or weeks, as well as rends of increased snowfall. Additonally, I will explore the instances of visits in relation to abnormal weather patterns. 

I have not yet decided on a seconary dataset, but this will likely include exploring open data from Durham county. 

## Methods

This project will creat a Shiny app to allow users to explore the relationship between weather trends and services provided to homeless populations. 

Methods will include an analysis of correlation and linear regression. A Tidyverse workflow will characterize the coding techniques of the data.

## Hypotheses

I hypothesize that extreme weather events (which will be defined as I explore weather data) act as an obstacle to receiving resources like food and clothes. I also expect there will be less visits on days that experienced above-average weather events, like more snow or higher temperatures. Thus, on days that experience more extreme or above-average weather events means less people were able to visit UMD to receive services.
