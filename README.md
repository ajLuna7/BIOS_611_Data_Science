## Description of Data

The data comes from Urban Ministries of Durham and describes the variety of services provided for clients over a multi-decadal time period. The data is stored as a .TSV file and includes both numeric and categorical data.

## Project 1: Initial Plan and Concept

I will  explore the relationship between Pounds of Food given and the Number of People who received food. If possible, I would like to explore if these variables show any trends in relationship to another variable, like the amount of clothing people received.  

The aim of this first project will be an analysis and visualization to show patterns or relationships in the data using Tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot2 packages.

Through a cursory exploration of the raw data, the 'Food Pounds' variable lends itself nicely to a bar graph, and the 'Food Pounds' and 'Clothing Items' will be explored using point graphs.

## Methodology

This project will rely on the `tidyverse` for data cleaning and organization, as well as the `ggplot2` package for visualization. I will explore data on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. At certain points, I aggregate the data to find the sum per day and per month.
