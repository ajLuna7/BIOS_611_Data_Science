## Project 1: Initial Plan and Concept

I will try to explore the relationship between Pounds of Food given and the Number of People who received food. If possible, I would like to explore if these variables show any trends in relationship to another variable, perhaps the kind of services they receive. If I do this, I will try to break the descriptions of the kind of services into different categories. 

The aim of this first project will be a visualization to show patterns or relationships in the data.

Through a cursory exploration of the raw data, the 'Food Pounds' variable and the 'Food Provided for' lend themselves nicely to a point graph.

## Description of Data

The data comes from Urban Ministries of Durham and describes the variety of services provided for clients over a multi-decadal time period. The data is stored as a .TSV file and includes both numeric and categorical data. 

## Methodology

This project will rely on the `tidyverse` for data cleaning and organization, as well as the `ggplot2` package for visualization.
