## Project 1: Initial Plan and Concept

I will try to explore the relationship between Pounds of Food given and the Number of People who received food. If possible, I would like to explore if these variables show any trends in relationship to another variable, perhaps the kind of services they receive. If I do this, I will try to break the descriptions of the kind of services into different categories. 

The aim of this first project will be a visualization to show patterns or relationships in the data.

Through a cursory exploration of the raw data, the 'Food Pounds' variable and the 'Food Provided for' lend themselves nicely to a point graph.
